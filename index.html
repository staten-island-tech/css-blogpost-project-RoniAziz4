            <h1 class="head1"> Sushi</h1>
            <h2 class="body"> Probably the most popular asian cuisine in America and for good reason. 
                It just tastes good. The ingredients complement each other outstndingly and doesnt leave much not to be desired. 
                Eel based sushi is typically my favourite, although cheap sushi is usually recipe for disaster espeically their sushimi which is usually too slimy.</h2>

            <h1 class="head1">Smoothie</h1>
            <h2 class="body">Although its not technically food its still just so good except that white smoothie everything is wrong with it
                but otherwise smoothies are goated and good for a quick hangout/date.</h2>

        <div class="background3">
            <h1 class="head1">Wings</h1>
            <h2 class="body">Best food by far. Especially mango habanero sauce on it. Delectable. Very versatile and very good food to enjoy with buddies.
                Bad wings though are absolutely fatal, you need to find that one good spot, good for a second date, never first.</h2>
